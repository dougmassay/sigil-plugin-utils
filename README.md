## sigil-plugin-utils

A python module with useful functions to provide shortcuts, wrapppers, and compatibility routines between Sigil's Qt and the PySide6/Pyqt5 modules used by Sigil plugins.

For examples of its use, see the comments in plugin_utils.py. There's also a Qt template Sigil plugin with lot's of comments and code examples located [here](https://github.com/dougmassay/sigil-qtplugin-template/releases)

Also see the [Sigil TagMechanic](https://github.com/dougmassay/tagmechanic-sigil-plugin/releases/latest) plugin that has been updated to work with both PyQt5 and PySide6.

Many of Mobileread user @Doitsu's plugins have been updated to be compatible with both PyQt5 and PySide6. Check out the [Sigil plugin index at Mobileread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=247431) to find his plugins.
